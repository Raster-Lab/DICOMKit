## Requirements

- **macOS**: 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- **Xcode**: 15.0 or later
- **Swift**: 5.9 or later
- **Dependencies**: DICOMKit v1.0+

## Building

### Using XcodeGen

```bash
# Generate Xcode project
cd DICOMViewer-macOS
xcodegen
open DICOMViewer.xcodeproj
```

### Manual Setup

1. Create a new macOS App project in Xcode
2. Set deployment target to macOS 14.0
3. Add DICOMKit package dependency
4. Copy source files from this directory
5. Build and run

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for detailed instructions.

## Usage

### Opening DICOM Files

**File Menu**:
```
File → Open... (⌘O)
File → Import Folder... (⌘⇧O)
File → Import DICOMDIR...
```

**Drag and Drop**:
- Drag DICOM files directly to app window
- Drag folders containing DICOM files
- Drag DICOMDIR files from CD/DVD

### PACS Operations

**Query PACS**:
```
Network → Query... (⌘K)
Network → Worklist... (⌘⇧K)
```

**Retrieve Studies**:
1. Query PACS for studies
2. Select studies to retrieve
3. Click "Retrieve" button
4. Monitor download progress in queue

**Send to PACS**:
```
Select study → Right-click → Send to PACS...
```

### Viewing Images

**Multi-Viewport Layouts**:
- 1×1: Single viewport (⌘1)
- 2×2: Four viewports (⌘2)
- 3×3: Nine viewports (⌘3)
- 4×4: Sixteen viewports (⌘4)

**Hanging Protocols**:
Use the Protocol menu to automatically arrange series:
- CT Chest: 2×2 layout with axial, coronal, sagittal views
- CT Abdomen: 2×2 layout with arterial, venous, delayed phases
- MR Brain: 3×3 layout with T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, ADC
- X-Ray: Single viewport

**Viewport Linking**:
Link viewports to synchronize:
- Scroll: Navigate through slices together
- W/L: Adjust window/level in all viewports
- Zoom: Magnify all viewports together
- Pan: Move all images simultaneously

**Window/Level**:
- Drag with left mouse button
- Preset shortcuts:
  - ⌘L: Lung window
  - ⌘B: Bone window
  - ⌘S: Soft tissue window
  - ⌘⇧B: Brain window

**Cine Playback**:
For multi-frame series:
- Space: Play/pause cine
- Arrow keys: Navigate frames
- FPS selector: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60 fps
- Loop and reverse modes available

**Navigation**:
- Scroll wheel: Change slice
- Arrow keys: Navigate series
- Mouse drag: Pan image (when zoomed)

### MPR and 3D

**MPR Views**:
```
View → MPR → Standard (⌘M)
View → MPR → Oblique (⌘⇧M)
```

**Volume Rendering**:
```
View → 3D → Volume Render (⌘3)
View → 3D → MIP (⌘⇧3)
```

## Performance

### Benchmarks
- **Study Loading**: <2 seconds for 100-image series
- **Volume Rendering**: 30+ fps for 512×512×200 volumes
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB for typical CT/MR studies
- **PACS Query**: <1 second response time
- **Large Study Download**: 100+ MB/sec on gigabit network

### Optimization Tips
- Enable hardware acceleration (Metal)
- Use memory-mapped files for large studies
- Configure connection pooling for PACS
- Enable thumbnail caching
- Use prefetching for series navigation

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run specific test suite
swift test --filter DICOMViewerTests

# Run with coverage
swift test --enable-code-coverage
```

**Test Coverage**: ~70% (224 tests implemented, 360+ tests planned for Phase 5)
