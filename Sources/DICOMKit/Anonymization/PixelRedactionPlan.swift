/// Decides **which pixel regions to blank** to remove burned-in identifiers, and
/// records how that decision was reached.
///
/// ## Why this is a separate type
///
/// Region geometry deliberately does **not** live in ``ConfidentialityProfile/table``.
/// That table is a transcription of PS3.15 Table E.1-1 — a *tag* table, keyed by
/// attribute with an action code. Pixel redaction is keyed by *device and geometry*
/// and produces rectangles. fo-dicom's profile is auto-generated from the same
/// standard table, which structurally forecloses region rules; keeping the two
/// representations apart avoids inheriting that dead end.
///
/// ## The decision, in order
///
/// 1. **Caller-specified regions** — an explicit instruction always wins.
/// 2. **Keep-region inversion** — when the data set declares where the clinical
///    image is (Ultrasound Regions), blank everything *else*. Fail-safe: the
///    default is destruction, so undiscovered text outside the scan area goes too.
/// 3. **Device templates** — curated per Modality/Manufacturer/geometry.
/// 4. **Nothing applies** → ``Decision/unresolved``. Never a silent pass-through:
///    CTP's default (unmatched object forwarded unmodified, logged as success) is
///    the failure mode this type exists to avoid.
///
/// Strategies are *not* alternatives that override one another — a resolved plan may
/// union several sources. Detection may only ever **add** to the mask, never shrink it,
/// because a false positive costs blanked background while a false negative leaks PHI.
