// DICOM Studio — Window menu entries for the app's auxiliary windows.
//
// The Printer Emulator and the Print Preview are opened from inside the app —
// the sidebar entry, the viewer's print action — and both are declared with
// `.restorationBehavior(.disabled)` and `.defaultLaunchBehavior(.suppressed)`
// so a cold launch shows the study library instead of an emulator nobody asked
// for. That is right at launch, but it also means macOS never brings them back
// on its own: clicking the Dock icon reopens only the main window, and a closed
// emulator has no menu entry to reopen it from. These commands are that entry.
// They sit above the Window menu's own window list, so both windows are always
// one menu away whether they are closed, buried, or on another display.

/// `openWindow(id:)` on a single `Window` scene raises the existing window
/// rather than making a second one, so these are both "open" and "bring to
/// front" in one command, which is what the Window menu is for.
