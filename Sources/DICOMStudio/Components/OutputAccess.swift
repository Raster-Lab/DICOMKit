// OutputAccess.swift
// DICOMStudio
//
// Shared, sandbox/TCC-resilient output writer for CLI Workshop tools.
//
// WHY: tools that write a report/output file used to do `try? data.write(to:
// URL(fileURLWithPath: typedPath))`. On macOS, writing to a typed path under
// ~/Desktop, ~/Documents, etc. is blocked by **TCC (privacy)** — even when the
// App Sandbox is off, and even though POSIX reports the directory writable. The
// old code either silently swallowed the failure (no file, no message) or
// errored, which surfaced to users as an "access issue" when saving a report.
//
// FIX: a single helper that (1) prefers the security-scoped URL the Browse
// picker grants (always writable), (2) else tries the typed path, and (3) on
// failure falls back to ~/Downloads/DICOMStudio/<subfolder>/<filename> (the
// Downloads entitlement is always granted) and returns a user-facing note so the
// redirect is visible, never silent. The headless parity harness is unaffected:
// it writes to a genuinely-writable temp path, so step (2) succeeds and there is
// no redirect.
