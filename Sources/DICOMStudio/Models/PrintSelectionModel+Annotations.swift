// DICOM Studio — the text and arrows a reader draws on an image.
//
// An annotation belongs to the image it is drawn on, not to any one film
// mark: the same frame can be marked onto more than one film cell, and the
// main viewer shows an image's annotations whether or not that image is
// marked at all. They are held per image identity, in coordinates normalized
// to the image, and the same values drive the print-tray preview overlay,
// the main viewer's GPU overlay, and (while a print run is composing) the
// burn into film pixels.
//
// Nothing here renders. See ``ImageAnnotationBurner`` for the CPU drawing
// that reaches the printer and ``AnnotationTextureBuilder`` for the GPU
// texture the main viewer composites.
