// DICOM Studio — bridges a reader's drawn annotations (`DICOMPrintKit`) to
// the GPU texture the main viewer's Metal pipeline composites over a frame
// (`DICOMRenderKit`). Sibling to `PrintCellTextureCache`, which does the same
// kind of bridging for the frame texture itself: `DICOMRenderKit` and
// `DICOMPrintKit` do not depend on each other, so this lives in `DICOMStudio`,
// the one target that already depends on both.
//
// The actual drawing — halo, arrowhead geometry, text anchor — is
// `ImageAnnotationBurner`'s: this only turns its rasterized bytes into an
// `MTLTexture`. Keeping the drawing in one place is what makes the viewer's
// overlay a promise the print path can't quietly stop keeping.
