// DICOM Studio — the study's series, and hanging them in tiles.
//
// The viewer's left pane lists every series of the open study. A series is hung
// in a tile by dragging its card onto the tile, or by selecting the tile and
// double-clicking the card. Each tile keeps its own series, so a 2×2 can show
// four different series of the same study side by side.
