// DICOM Studio — the printer emulator as a window of its own.
//
// The emulator is watched while something else is being done: a print is sent
// from the Print screen, or an SCU is being debugged in another app, and the
// film that comes back has to be visible at the same time. A detail pane inside
// the split view can only ever be the one thing on screen, so the emulator gets
// a real window and the navigation entry becomes the switch that raises it.

#if canImport(SwiftUI)

/// Identifiers of the app's auxiliary windows.
public enum StudioWindowID: Sendable {
    /// The printer emulator window.
    public static let printerEmulator = "printer-emulator"
}

/// What the Printer Emulator navigation entry shows in the main window: a card
/// explaining where the emulator went, and the button that brings it back.
///
/// The window is raised as soon as the entry is chosen, so this is what remains
/// behind it — not a dead end, but the way back when the window has been closed
/// or is buried behind the main one.
